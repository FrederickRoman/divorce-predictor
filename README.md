# divorce-predictor
This is a divorce predictor using a neural network. The moded is trained on the UCI dataset using tensorflow, then converted to tfjs. It runs on a python jupyter notebook.

## Getting Started

This project is self-contained. It has both the data and the code. All you need to meet the prerequisites and run the jupyter notebook cells in train.ipynb.

### Prerequisites

Python>=3.8.6

```
math
pandas 
numpy 
tensorflow 
tensorflowjs
```
## External deployment (not on this repo)

This is the model was trained and converted to tfjs to be used on the [Divorsee](https://divorsee.netlify.app) client-side web app. It runs live [here](https://divorsee.netlify.app) and its repository is [here](https://github.com/FrederickRoman/Divorsee).
